Problem Statements
------------------
1.	Current method too manual and double entries actually. Some simple automation can ease up whole data entry. Like when input rumi automatically translate to jawi, also after enter date value auto convert to Islamic date.
2.	Do not know who are unpaid and total amount. Currently there is separate page to retrieve this data. Not a single solution.
